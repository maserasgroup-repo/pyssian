GaussianOutFile
---------------

*pyssian.GaussianOutFile* can be opened as a file object. When reading an
already finished calculation file it is recommended to use the with statement as
in this first example. If the file is being written the recommended way to open
the file is as example 2 or 3.

.. code:: python

   from pyssian import GaussianOutFile

   outputfile = 'myfile.log'

   # Example 1
   with GaussianOutFile(outputfile) as GOF1:
       GOF1.read()

   # Example 2
   GOF2 = GaussianOutFile(outputfile)
   GOF2.read()
   GOF2.close()

   # Example 3
   with open(outputfile,'r') as F: 
       GOF3 = GaussianOutFile(F)
       GOF3.read()


It also accepts another parameter that indicates which Links are of interest.
The default behaviour (without specifying any value) is to consider all links.

A second option, only used to see the structure of the file without actually
storing any information of each link is to pass -1 as the first value:

.. code:: python

   outputfile = 'myfile.log'
   with GaussianOutFile(outputfile,parselist=[-1,]) as GOF:
       GOF.update(clean=False) # read is an alias for update(clean=True)

If you specify the numbers of the links to the GOF only those will be parsed and
will not be cleaned afterwards.

.. code:: python

   outputfile = 'myfile.log'
   with GaussianOutFile(outputfile,[1,103,202,502,9999]) as GOF:
       GOF.read()


GaussianInFile
--------------

*pyssian.GaussianInFile* can be instantiated either from an existing input file
or to create a new file.

.. note::

   Please be aware that proper support for method-basis management as well as 
   for oniom and zmatrix geometries is not yet fully implemented.

The following Code snippet shows how to create a new input from an existing
one changing the geometry and method but retaining the rest of the options

.. code:: python

   from pyssian import GaussianInFile

   initial_theory_file = 'InitialTheory.com'
   initial_geometry_file = 'InitialGeometry.com'
   output_file = 'generated.com'

   with GaussianInFile(initial_theory_file) as theory_file:
       theory_file.read()
      
   with GaussianInFile(initial_geometry_file) as geometry_file:
       geometry_file.read()
      
   old_geometry = theory_file.geometry # In case we want to use it somewhere else
   
   theory_file.geometry = geometry_file.geometry
   theory_file.method = 'b3lyp'
   
   theory_file.write(filepath=output_file)


It combines fairly well with pyssian.classutils.Geometry to create inputs from
outputs. The following code snippet is an example of how to create an input to
continue an optimization that failed due to exceeding the number of optimization
steps.

.. code:: python

   from pyssian import GaussianInFile, GaussianOutFile
   from pyssian.classutils import Geometry

   with GaussianOutFile('old_calculation.log') as GOF:
      GOF.read()

   # Get the last geometry of the calculation
   geom = Geometry.from_L202(GOF.get_links(202)[-1])

   # Get the Link1 of the GaussianOutFile
   l1 = GOF.get_links(1)[0]

   # Extract the calculation type and commands
   commandline = l1.commandline
   nprocs = l1.nprocs
   mem = l1.mem
   preprocessing = l1.link0

   # Get Charge and spin from Link101
   Link101 = GOF.get_links(101)[0]
   charge = Link101.charge
   spin = Link101.spin

   # Now write the new input file
   with GaussianInFile('new_calculation.com') as GIF:
       GIF.parse_commandline([commandline,])
       # We can instead set a dict for the variable GIF.commandline
       # "GIF.commandline = {'opt':'','freq':'NoRamman','b3lyp':''}"
       # but using parse_commandline is easier in this case.
       # we can also add keywords to the command line either directly
       # GIF.commandline['keyword'] = ''
       # or with a method
       # GIF.add_kwd('keyword')
       GIF.preprocessing = {key:'' for key in Link0}
       GIF.preprocessing['nprocshared'] = nprocs
       GIF.preprocessing['mem'] = mem
       GIF.title = 'New Title'
       GIF.spin = spin
       GIF.charge = charge
       GIF.geometry = geom
       GIF.write()


Cube
----

*pyssian.classutils.Cube* class was introduce to simplify the sometimes a bit 
bothersome usage of cubeman from gaussian to add, substract, multiply... cube 
files. You can initialize an empty cube and populate it yourself, but the class 
was thought to be used as follows: 

.. code:: python

   from pyssian.classutils import Cube 

   MO_1 = Cube.from_file('MO_01.cube')
   MO_2 = Cube.from_file('MO_02.cube')
   MO_3 = Cube.from_file('MO_03.cube')
   
   FinalCube = MO_1*2 + MO_2 - MO_3**2
   
   FinalCube.write('Final.cube') 

.. warning:: 

   Current implementation works for Molecular Orbital Cubes, other cubes may 
   fail to be read. 


LinkJob
-------

The *pyssian.LinkJob* class is the base class for all the LinkJob subclasses
And implements the two basic attributes of all Links, *.number* and *.text*.
Currently the specific parsers implemented are:

- Link1
- Link101
- Link103
- Link120
- Link123
- Link202
- Link502
- Link508
- Link601
- Link716
- Link804
- Link913
- Link914

.. note::

   For an up to date list of parsers and properties please check the pyssian
   API documentation

.. code:: python

   with GaussianOutFile(File) as GOF:
